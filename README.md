# AND101 Project 2 - Kotlin Debug-a-thon

Submitted by: Yousif Abdejawad

Time spent: **1** hours spent in total

## In this assignment, I was able to perform basic debugging of an android app using the Logcat and my knowledge of programming and Kotlin to solve problems that have been causing the app to crash

No more Bugs is an android app that was riddled with some pretty nasty Kotlin bugs.  With those gone, it's a collection of widgets for a variety of purposes!  **Change or add to this description**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: ****

## Application Features:
The application has 6 tabs, each of which performs a different function. These functions include printing Hello World, the sum to '2+2', the current date, having the screen change to random colors, printing a list and printing my favorite number
